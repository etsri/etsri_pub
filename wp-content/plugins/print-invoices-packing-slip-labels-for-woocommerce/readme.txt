WooCommerce Print Invoice in PDF, WooCommerce Packing List, WooCommerce Label and WooCommerce Delivery Note.

== Description ==

= Introduction =
It is a good practice to include an invoice and packing list when you are shipping a package. It serves as a confirmation of what the package contains along with your contact information and the details of the purchase. It also establishes an extra line of communication between you and the customer and adds a human touch.
Furthermore, when you sell internationally, many countries require an invoice to be included. The Invoice should contain all the required order details (such as name and address of your company, billing address of your customer, a list of all order items including taxes and totals). 
WooCommerce, by default, doesn’t allow you to Print Invoice, packing list or shipping label from your orders page. With this plugin, you can generate Invoice, Shipment Label and Packing List.

= Features =
* <strong>Print Invoice, Packing List, Delivery Note & Label from within WooCommerce Order Page. </strong>
* <strong>Generate PDF Shipping Label, PDF Packing Slip, PDF Delivery Note and PDF Invoice.</strong>
* <strong>Auto generate customized Invoice Number. Or use Order Number as Invoice Number.</strong>
* <strong>Generate Shipping/Address Label:</strong> Generate and print shipping label from within Woocommerce.From WordPress admin area, you can generate label for single order from order details page. 
* <strong>Configure Base Ship From Address </strong>: You can set the base address of the store which will be used in the label as the 'shipping from' address.
* <strong>Customize with Store Name.</strong>
* <strong>Preview before printing</strong>: This feature allows you to view what a printed Label would look like on the screen before printing a hard copy.
